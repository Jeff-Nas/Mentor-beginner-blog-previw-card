## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I learned to use `tabindex="0"` to make an element that is not naturally focusable (like <div>, <span>, <li>, etc.) receive focus with Tab.
I also learned that when inserting an image into a container, it must have its height and width properties defined. Otherwise the image will try to fill 100% of the header height, but the header will automatically try to adapt to the image size. This creates an ineffective loop, and the image cropping never happens.


```html
<h1 `tabindex="0"`>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.card>header {
    height: 12rem;
    overflow: hidden;
    border-radius: 12px;
}
```
